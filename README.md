Administrative web application for appointments.

This was an application to manage the available timeslots for doctors to see patients and record patient data. It allows patients to log in and make appointments, see and change appointments and change their user data.

I received the requirement page for the application. After studying the document I Designed a Rough version of the layout of the program's different forms on paper with the database fields to be required. After analysis of this, I attempted to develop the application's first iteration with databases.

After testing and analysis, I developed the application further until the final iteration was completed and this version is found on GitHub.
